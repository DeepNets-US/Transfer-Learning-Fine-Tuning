# **Transfer Learning with TensorFlow**

**Overview:**
This repository explores the concept and implementation of transfer learning using TensorFlow. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed or adapted for use on a different, but related task. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, we can achieve significant improvements in performance, especially when working with limited data.

**Contents:**
1. **Introduction to Transfer Learning:**
   - Explanation of transfer learning and its benefits.
